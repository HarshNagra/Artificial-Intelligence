# Constraint Satisfaction - Propagator

You will implement python functions to realize two constraint propagators â€“ a Forward Checking con- straint propagator and a Generalized Arc Consistence (GAC) constraint propagator. These propagators are briefly described below. The files cspbase.py and propagators.py provide the complete input/output specification of the functions you are to implement. In all cases, the CSP object is used to access variables and constraints of the problem, via methods found in cspbase.py.

Futoshiki part is WIP.
